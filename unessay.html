  justify their stance. Studies also show that your attitudes towards race affect your attitudes towards general policy, like
  the death penalty. People are more likely to perceive Black men as larger than white men of the same size. People are more likely to 
  associate crime related imagery (guns, knives) with Black people than white. Similarly, people are more likely to associate Black people
  with crime imagery than white people with crime imagery.">

  "Officers have an incredible amount of discretion. It's part of the job. There's no way to reliably have constant
  oversight over every officer. As such, they get to choose who they pull over, who gets a ticket, who is a threat, and so on.
  This discretion has some pros, like when an arrest or ticket is technically required by law but the officer decides not to give 
  it based on the situation. However, there are many cons too. How does any individual officer decide who to pull over? Especially since
  we have shown evidence of bias in the average person. Studies show officers are racially biased, pulling over, arresting, and using force
   on POC more often then whites. Also being more rude to POC than whites." >

  "There was a shift from reactive policing to proactive policing. Police went from merely responding to
  calls proactively looking for crimes/deterring people from committing them. Since police have so much discretion, it's up to the officer to decide what's suspicious, leaving a lot of room
  for bias. This leads into a more contemporary form of policing, Broken Windows. Broken Windows policing is where police's jobs are extended to 'upholding
  the standards of the community.' This can be problematic because who decides what the standards are? And these standards aren't within the 
  rule of law necessarily, leaving police with the (perceived) power to enforce anything they see fit.  " >

  algorithms are designed to predict where to send police. However, there are a lot of flaws to this. Where does the data come from?
  How can we ensure it's not biased? How can we ensure there's no feedback loops? These are also opaque. How can we trust it if 
  we don't know how it gets its answer? On the other side of technology, body cameras grow in popularity. Another set of questions arises with these.
  How can we enforce officer compliance? How much can we trust footage? Especially in court? " >

  respect into policing. If citizens respect and believe in police, then violence can be avoided. The four aspects of PJ are voice, 
  neutrality, trustworthiness, and respect. If an officer can exhibit all four of these, will the community trust in him? In the institution?
  Is PJ enough? Is it the bare minimum? How can PJ overcome the centuries of racism and mistrust? However, studies do show that PJ
  can reduce crime, arrests, and police violence.">

  consistent? When is the right time? What is the right intervention? They are highly individualized. Can we diversify the police force? Will that help?
  Maybe, but again it may not be enough. How can we encourage the right people to apply? Can we pay officers better? But should we be defunding the police? Perhaps
  defunding in some areas and funding in others?" >

  community violence 'interrupters.' But if the police are 
  going to continue to exist, how can they be improved? Should we take away their guns? But how would they be kept safe?
  Can you improve training with PJ? Studies show yes, but how can we make the training stick? Would more oversight work? We've seen evidence 
  of this in NYC. Should we break up the toxic camradery? But is this camradery important in such a high stress job?
  There are more questions than answers in this half of the line, because frankly there's no clear answers for police reform in the US.">
