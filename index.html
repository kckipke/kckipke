          <h1>Hi, I'm Keegan</h1>

          <p> Welcome to my personal website. </p>
          <p> It's a bit of a work in progress as I learn web design/development, but feel free to still take a look around. I decided to build it completely froms scratch
            instead of using a template (I'm sure that's obvious based on the aesthetics) so I could improve my skills. We're getting there, though.
          </p>
          <p> I'm a junior studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I'm also minoring in sustainability. In my free time, 
            I enjoy running, weightlifting, science fiction novels, and the NYT crossword (all the NYT games, really). I'm currently looking
            for a summer 2024 internship, ideally as a software engineer. </p>
          <p> I've completed courses in data structures and algorithms, computer organization, discrete math, and more. Next semester, I plan on taking cybersecurity, 
              web development, and intro to ML. This year, I'm working as a teaching assistant for EECS 183, the introductory
              computer science course here at UM. I teach a weekly lab section, hold office hours, help write and administer 
              exams, and more. Other recent work experience includes being a CS tutor, a line cook at an upscale restaurant,
              database management for a doctor/expert witness, and a software engineering intern at a local biotech company.  </p>
